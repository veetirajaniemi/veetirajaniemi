I'm a third-year computational engineering student who enjoys solving problems with programming and mathematics! I'm especially interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning and data analysis. 

There are some of my coding projects: 

| Title | Description | Repository | Languages |
| ----- | ----------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Database Design - Premier League 22/23 | I created an SQL database about statistics of a Premier League season 22/23 with a simple Python interface. | [Project repository](https://github.com/veetirajaniemi/BasicsOfDatabaseSystems) | [![Languages](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=sqlite,py)](https://skillicons.dev) | 
| Statistical Portal - Municipality Election | A web project in which I visualize Finland's map based on municipality election data. | [Project repository](https://github.com/veetirajaniemi/Introduction-To-Web-Programming/tree/main/Project) | [![Languages](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=js,html,css)](https://skillicons.dev) |
| Project Work - Operating Systems and System Programming | A three-part project written in C. Part 1: Warmup to C and Unix programming - Coding a simple program to reverse text. Part 2: Unix Utilities - Implementing own versions of Unix-commands `cat`, `grep`, `zip` and `unzip`. Part 3: Unix Shell - Implementing my own Unix-shell. | [Project repository](https://github.com/veetirajaniemi/Operating-Systems-and-System-Programming) | [![Languages](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=c)](https://skillicons.dev) |
