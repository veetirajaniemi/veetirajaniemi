### Me
I'm a computational engineering student who enjoys solving problems with programming and mathematics! I'm especially interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence and data analysis. 

### My projects
There are some of my coding projects: 

| Title | Description | Repository | Languages |
| ----- | ----------- | ---------- | --------- |
| [Bachelor's thesis about eCDF estimator](https://lutpub.lut.fi/handle/10024/167376) | Updated some functionalities of Python package about eCDF estimator (created by Andreas Rupp) and created tutorial notebooks about it. | [ecdf_estimator package](https://github.com/AndreasRupp/ecdf_estimator), [Tutorials for the package](https://github.com/AndreasRupp/ecdf_estimator_examples/tree/main) | [![Languages](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py&perline=2)](https://skillicons.dev) |
| 3D Digit Classifier | Implementing convolutional neural network for recognizing digits 0-9 from 3D coordinates, also includes data preprocessing and feature extraction. Project work for course "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" in collaboration with [Eetu Knutars](https://github.com/knuutti) and [Eetu Peltola](https://github.com/EetuPeltolaCodes). | [Project repository](https://github.com/knuutti/3d-digit-classifier) | [![Languages](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=py,pytorch&perline=2)](https://skillicons.dev)| 
| PyTorch for Deep Learning |  A PyTorch course to understand its' usage in different classification problems.
